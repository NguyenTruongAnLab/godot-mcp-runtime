# Test fixtures

## `godot-project/`

A minimal Godot 3.6 project used as a stable test surface for MCP tools. Committed to the repo (unlike `.test-project/`, which is gitignored for ad-hoc local testing) so contributors and CI share the same baseline.

Contents:
- `project.godot` - minimal config, references `main.tscn` as main scene
- `main.tscn` - `Node2D` root with `Label` and `Sprite` child
- `placeholder.gd`, `placeholder.png` - empty placeholder files used by handler tests that exercise `attach_script` / `load_sprite` runner-throws paths

Use it from tests by importing the path helper:

```ts
import { fixtureProjectPath } from '../helpers/fixture-paths.js';
```

`tests/helpers/fixture-paths.ts` exports `fixtureProjectPath`, `fixtureScenePath`, and `fixtureSceneAbsPath` so individual specs don't redo the `fileURLToPath` / `dirname` / `join` boilerplate.

Tests that exercise headless Godot (validate, scene operations) skip themselves when `GODOT_PATH` is not set, so this fixture is also safe to leave in place when Godot is not installed.

When you change a tool's contract, update this fixture or add a sibling fixture under `tests/fixtures/` rather than mutating `main.tscn` in place - old tests may depend on the existing shape.
