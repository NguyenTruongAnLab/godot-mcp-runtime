Headless operations spawn Godot with `--headless --script godot_operations.gd`, perform the operation, and return JSON. Runtime operations communicate over a long-lived TCP connection with the injected `McpBridge` autoload (4-byte big-endian length prefix + UTF-8 JSON frames).

## How the Bridge Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as MCP Client (Agent)
    participant Node as Node MCP Server
    participant Bridge as McpBridge (Autoload)
    participant Game as Godot Game

    Agent->>Node: run_project
    Node->>Bridge: inject mcp_bridge.gd + register autoload
    Node->>Game: spawn Godot (--headless? no, with window)
    Game->>Bridge: _ready() opens TCP listener on 127.0.0.1
    Node->>Bridge: connect (lazy, on first runtime call)
    Bridge-->>Node: connection established

    loop Runtime tool calls
        Agent->>Node: take_screenshot / simulate_input / run_script
        Node->>Bridge: framed JSON command
        Bridge->>Game: execute against live SceneTree
        Bridge-->>Node: framed JSON response
        Node-->>Agent: result
    end

    Agent->>Node: stop_project
    Node->>Bridge: shutdown command
    Bridge->>Game: release port, exit
    Node->>Node: remove mcp_bridge.gd + autoload entry
```

When `run_project` or `attach_project` is called:

1. `mcp_bridge.gd` is copied into the project directory
2. It's registered as an autoload in `project.godot`
3. Godot launches with the bridge listening on `127.0.0.1`. Both `run_project` and `attach_project` auto-select a free port when `bridgePort` is omitted; pass `bridgePort` to pin a specific port. The resolved port is baked into the per-project bridge script at inject time, so the listener and the Node-side socket always agree.
4. The Node side opens a long-lived TCP connection on first runtime call and sends framed JSON commands; the bridge replies on the same connection
5. `stop_project` or `detach_project` sends a `shutdown` command (so the bridge releases the port cleanly), then removes the bridge script and autoload entry

## Runtime Artifacts

Files generated during runtime (screenshots, executed scripts) are stored in `.mcp/` inside the project directory. This directory is automatically added to `.gitignore` and has a `.gdignore` so Godot won't import it.

`take_screenshot` defaults to `responseMode: "preview"` — the full PNG is saved to `.mcp/screenshots/` and a 960x540-bounded preview is returned inline. Override per call:

- `responseMode: "full"` — return the full inline PNG when the agent needs to inspect exact pixels, small UI text, or texture detail.
- `responseMode: "path_only"` — skip the inline image entirely when another tool or human will inspect the saved file.
- `previewMaxWidth` / `previewMaxHeight` — override the default 960x540 preview bounds (e.g. `{ "responseMode": "preview", "previewMaxWidth": 480, "previewMaxHeight": 270 }`).

The response is a JSON text entry (`{ responseMode, path, size, previewPath?, previewSize?, warnings? }`) plus an inline `image` entry for `full` and `preview`.
